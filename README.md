## Restaurant Finder

### **Problem:**

Tired of searching for "best restaurants near me" on Google? Tired of the same few restaurants being recommended? Want to get an accurate estimation of how much to pay at a restaurant? Well this app solves all these problems.

### **Practical usages:**

This application combines elements of Google Review and Yelp. What's the main difference? It is more personal and unbiased.

After eating at a restaurant, you can select the restaurant, insert the price you paid for the meal, and add a review. You can add friends in this app. You are then able to view the entries made by your friends and the reviews they left at each restaurant. If you made a good suggestion, friends can like the recommendation. Users with a large amount of good suggestions will be awarded a title of "Food Connoisseur".

Together, the application also compiles a top list of reviewed restaurants by friends and displays them on a dashboard for the user. There is also another suggestion for users to try less popular/ less tried restaurants.
